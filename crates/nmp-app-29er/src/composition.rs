//! 29er composition root (ADR-0069 explicit composition).
//!
//! The single Rust entry point that turns a fresh, unstarted NMP app host into
//! a fully-composed 29er app: the substrate floor (routing, NIP-65 mailbox
//! cache, coverage gate, blocked-relay handling — everything `nmp-substrate`
//! owns) and the NIP-29 action namespaces.
//!
//! It is shared by BOTH 29er shells:
//! * [`crate::TwentyNinerApp`] (the UniFFI facade) calls it on its own,
//!   unstarted `nmp-native-runtime` app inside its constructor;
//! * the native Rust TUI calls it on its own `nmp-native-runtime` app before
//!   `start`.
//!
//! Composition lives here (not upstream in NMP) because NIP-29 is NOT part of
//! the substrate floor every Nostr app inherits — a notes-only app would not
//! register it. This is the per-app boundary D0 keeps outside `nmp-core`.
//!
//! ## Why not `nmp-defaults::register_defaults_with_handles`
//!
//! A previous hidden-default composition path installed "the canonical NMP
//! default action set" (NIP-02/17/57/65, DM-inbox + zap-receipts runtimes).
//! `nmp-defaults` is deleted upstream (ADR-0069 kills hidden default bundles
//! in favor of explicit, named composition; the crate and every
//! `register_defaults*` entry point are banned doctrine-lint tokens as of the
//! pin in this workspace's `Cargo.toml`). That bundle also contradicted 29er's
//! own stated S01 scope — this crate's module docs have always said 29er
//! "carries no DM / Marmot / Wallet / Search / Embed projections in S01" —
//! so composing only the substrate floor + NIP-29 here is both the only
//! available option and the architecturally correct one: 29er now declares
//! exactly what it uses instead of inheriting an all-in bundle it never
//! wanted. A future PR can add explicit, named feature installs (e.g.
//! `nmp_nip17::register_actions` for DMs) the same way, if/when 29er's product
//! scope grows to need them.
